REVISIONS FROM R2

ANTONIO
	1.(*) Add series resistor with gate to avoid damaging drivers from input capacitance
		*(Microcontrollers, gate drivers, etc.)
	2.(*) Add additional resistor below potentiometer to bias range effectively.
	3.(*) Adjust output on TS391 to remove pullup and reconfigure to open drain output.
	4.(*) Add feedback resistor to comparator to avoid output chatter in linear region.
	5.(/) Use layers 2 and 3 for routing in HV section. 
	6.( ) Add additional fill around headers to reduce pullout effects.
	7.(*) Decrease solder mask to 2 mil.
		*Having overlap of mask not detremental; additional areas to the toe and removeing
		from the heel allows for better drag soldering.
		*Increasing the area to the side of each leg allows for pools to form around the
		legs of the component rather than between the legs of the component. 
	8.( ) Reduce amount of heel in component footprints.
